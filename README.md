# Rectangle Border Animation

This is a Zoom In Animation for logo, icon or name of an app. It could be used as LaunchScreen, as Activity Indicator during loading a table view, a collection view and so on.

Software: Animation made with Flow.


# Usage
You just have to add your own personal logo, icon or name. Resize it according to your preferences and to background rectangle size (that you can always change as you prefer).
Once you're done, just export it in your preferred format. I used it as LaunchScreen in an iOS app.
